# React Multiple Apollo Clients

This is a very basic and rough [React](https://reactjs.org/) example project on how to implement multiple [Apollo clients](https://www.apollographql.com/apollo-client) with [GraphQL Code Generator](https://www.the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen) and without the usage of any additional packages.
